In this project, teams will design and develop a system that enables the client to implement a more streamlined referral process.  This solution will take the form of a web-based ticketing system supporting the generation of tickets/referrals, processing tickets/referrals and administering the system.  The team must take care to ensure that their solution works within the client organisation.  In particular, the system must respect and support the different types of user roles and adhere to organisational constraints and policies.
